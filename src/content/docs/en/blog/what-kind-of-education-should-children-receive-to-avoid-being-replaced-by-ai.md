##### Overview
The ability to engage in continuous learning, adapt quickly, demonstrate resilience, understand human nature, and collaborate globally will be key to remaining irreplaceable by AI in the future.

1. **Learning Ability:**  
   It involves not only acquiring knowledge but also mastering the methods of learning. Fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and the habit of self-directed learning enables children to continuously grow and evolve in an era of rapidly changing information.

2. **Adaptability:**  
   The capacity to flexibly adjust thinking and behavior in response to rapidly evolving technologies, industries, and social environments. This includes embracing new technologies, coping with uncertainty, and quickly finding one’s place in new contexts.

3. **Resilience:**  
   The mental strength to recover from failure and keep moving forward. It involves not only withstanding pressure and challenges but also transforming setbacks into opportunities for growth, while maintaining a positive mindset and motivation over the long term.

4. **Understanding Human Needs:**  
   Cultivating empathy and insight to genuinely understand others’ problems and expectations. This is not only the foundation for creating valuable products and services but also key to demonstrating the irreplaceable value of humans in an era of human-machine coexistence.

5. **Engaging with the World:**  
   Possessing a global perspective and cross-cultural communication skills to collaborate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds. At the same time, it involves understanding the relationship between society, technology, and ethics, and actively participating in building a responsible and sustainable future.

**Question**: You became a father this year. What education would you advise your son to pursue so that his job won't simply be replaced by AI in 30 years?

**Sam Altman**: Skill of learning how to learn, of learning to adapt, learning to be resilient to a lot of change. I mentioned this earlier, but learning how to figure out what people want, how to make useful products and services for them, how to interact in the world. I'm so confident that people will still be the center of the story for each other. And anything in that world, I think, will be great. 

And I'm also so confident that human desire for new stuff, desire to be useful to othe rpeople, desire to express our creativity. I think this is all limitless. In all these previous technological revolutions, people wondery so, what are we all going to do? In the industrial age, these machines came along and we watched them do the things that we used to do and said, what would be the role for us? 

And each new generation uses their creativity and new ideas and all of the tools that previous generation built for them to astonish us. And I'm sure my kids will do the same.
